# Digital Innovation Week — AI-Driven Management Cockpit (Valtronic)

## Context
This project was conducted during the **Digital Innovation Week** in collaboration with **Valtronic**, a Swiss SME specialized in the **subcontracting of medical products**.

Valtronic’s leadership was exploring how **artificial intelligence (AI)** could be leveraged to improve **operational steering, decision-making, and performance monitoring**, but without a clearly defined use case or implementation roadmap.

Our mission was to **identify relevant AI applications**, define a **realistic MVP**, and propose a **scalable architecture** adapted to an SME context.

---

## Project Objective
Design and propose an **AI-powered enterprise cockpit** to support top management decision-making by:

- Centralizing operational and financial data
- Improving KPI monitoring and interpretation
- Using AI to detect issues, generate insights, and recommend actions
- Defining a **phased MVP approach** compatible with Valtronic’s existing IT landscape

---

## My Role
**Digital Innovation / Business & AI Analyst (Group Project)**

Contributions included:
- Framing the business problem with Valtronic stakeholders
- Translating business needs into AI-enabled use cases
- Designing the MVP scope and implementation phases
- Contributing to data architecture, AI integration logic, and dashboard concepts
- Structuring risks, limitations, and governance considerations

---

## Problem Statement
Valtronic faced several challenges typical of industrial SMEs:

- Fragmented data sources (ERP, SAP, Excel, SharePoint, reports)
- Limited real-time visibility for top management
- Manual KPI interpretation and delayed insights
- Unclear understanding of **where AI could add real value**

Key questions addressed:
- How to design a **management cockpit** adapted to an SME?
- How to structure data for AI readiness?
- How to integrate AI progressively without disrupting operations?
- What type of AI is realistic and useful in the short term?

---

## Proposed Solution Overview
We proposed an **AI-augmented management cockpit**, combining:

- Structured ERP data as a reliable foundation
- Data harmonization and standardization
- Advanced analytics and predictive KPIs
- An AI layer capable of interpretation, anomaly detection, and recommendations
- A modern BI interface (Power BI)

---

## MVP Concept — “The Illusionist”
We introduced the concept of **“L’Illusionniste”**, a logical AI layer acting as an intermediary between raw data and decision-makers.

### Core Idea
Instead of replacing existing systems, AI acts as:
- A **data harmonizer**
- An **insight generator**
- A **decision-support assistant**

### Data Sources
- SAP
- ERP systems
- Excel files
- SharePoint

### Output
- Interactive **Power BI cockpit**
- AI-generated insights and recommendations
- Predictive and descriptive KPIs

---

## Methodology & Architecture

### Phase 1 — MVP (Short-Term)
**Focus: feasibility, reliability, and quick value**

- Use **ERP data only** (structured, reliable)
- Harmonize and consolidate data
- Design the cockpit based on existing KPIs
- Add a **LLM layer** for:
  - Natural language interaction with KPIs
  - Explanation of results
  - Basic recommendations

**Goal:** deliver value fast without complex data dependencies

---

### Phase 2 — Data Maturity
**Focus: data quality and consistency**

- Apply best practices:
  - Within each data source
  - Across data sources
- Standardize schemas and definitions
- Improve data governance and reliability

**Goal:** prepare the organization for advanced AI usage

---

### Phase 3 — Advanced AI & Automation
**Focus: predictive intelligence and automation**

- Push consolidated data to the cloud
- Apply deep learning models
- Automate:
  - KPI selection
  - Trend detection
  - Predictive analysis
- Enable AI-driven scenario simulations

**Goal:** move from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics

---

## AI Use Cases (Example: Finance Department)

### Inputs
- ERP fields:
  - Date
  - Revenue
  - Operational Cost
  - Profit / Loss

### AI Capabilities
- Identify abnormal patterns (e.g. revenue = 0 days)
- Detect trends and deviations from objectives
- Explain possible causes
- Recommend corrective actions

---

## KPI & AI Analysis Examples

### Finance
- Gross margin vs target
- Revenue evolution
- Cash flow anomalies

### Sales
- Zero-sales transactions
- Stock availability impact on sales
- Commercial activity gaps

### Inventory
- Stock-outs
- Replenishment delays
- Supplier dependency risks

AI outputs included:
- Problem identification
- Probable causes
- Actionable recommendations

---

## Risks & Limitations Identified

- Data quality dependency (“garbage in, garbage out”)
- Multiple formats and manual inputs
- Missing or corrupted data
- Overgeneralization by AI models
- Trust and explainability of AI outputs

Key insight:
> AI performance is directly linked to **data structure, governance, and maturity**

---

## Vision — The Dashboard of Tomorrow
We proposed a forward-looking cockpit featuring:

- Predictive KPIs and trend indicators
- Decision trees showing KPI impacts
- Scenario simulation (“what-if” analysis)
- AI-assisted decision automation
- Integration with future technologies:
  - IoT
  - Voice interfaces
  - Smart devices
  - Advanced visualization

---

## Key Learnings
- AI value starts with **clear business questions**, not models
- MVP thinking is critical for SME adoption
- Structured ERP data is the best entry point for AI
- AI should **augment decision-makers**, not replace them
- Digital innovation is as much about **governance and change** as technology
